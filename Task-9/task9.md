## Intro
An analysis of AdventureWorks employee salary data reveals several important correlations between demographic characteristics and pay levels. The strongest positive correlation is between age and salary: employees in the 60+ age group have the highest average hourly rate ($19.76), followed by employees aged 50-59 ($19.39), while the 40-49 age group earns significantly less ($14.53) . This trend reflects the traditional corporate structure, where experience and seniority directly influence compensation levels, as evidenced by the presence of predominantly older employees in top management, holding key positions such as CEO, vice president, and director.
An unexpected result of the analysis is the reverse gender correlation: women earn an average of $1.47 more per hour ($19.23 versus $17.76 for men), despite accounting for less than a third of the total number of employees (84 out of 290). Marital status also shows an interesting pattern: single employees earn more than married employees ($18.90 vs. $17.48). A comprehensive analysis of demographic factors confirms these trends: single women over 40 are in the lead in terms of pay ($21.43), while married men in the same age group earn the least ($17.40). This distribution may indicate the effectiveness of programs to ensure gender equality in pay and a possible correlation between career mobility and family status in the corporate environment.

## Details

### Gender analysis: Women's superiority in terms of pay
The data shows a surprising trend: women earn 8.3% more than men ($19.23 vs. $17.76 per hour), which contradicts global statistics on the gender pay gap. This phenomenon can be explained by several factors. First, the quality of positions: women at AdventureWorks hold highly specialized roles (VP Engineering, CFO, Finance Manager) that require high qualifications. Second, hiring selectivity: with a ratio of 84 women to 206 men, the company probably applies stricter selection criteria for female candidates, resulting in a higher average level of competence. Third, industry specifics: the technology sector actively invests in gender equality programs, which can lead to a compensatory effect.

An analysis of the maximum values shows an interesting pattern: although the absolute maximum belongs to a man (CEO with $125.5), the top four female positions demonstrate a more consistent high-paying structure. The standard deviation for women ($11.55) is less than for men ($12.53), indicating a more even distribution of salaries and the absence of a significant number of low-paying positions.

### Age factor: Premium for experience and seniority
The correlation between age and salary shows a clear positive trend with a marked jump after the age of 50. The 60+ age group earns 35.9% more than the 40-49 age group ($19.76 vs. $14.53), reflecting a premium for accumulated experience and attainment of top management positions. Interestingly, the minimum wage increases with age ($9.5 for 40-49 years old vs. $9.25 for 60+), indicating a lack of older employees in entry-level positions.

An analysis of top positions shows that 83% of leadership roles (CEO, VP level, directors) are held by employees over 50, with an average age of 58.7 for top management. This confirms the corporate model, where key decisions are made by experienced professionals with many years of experience.

### Marital status: The paradox of single leaders
The unexpected superiority of single employees over married ones ($18.90 vs. $17.48, a difference of 8.1%) requires detailed analysis. 73% of top management positions are held by single employees, including the CEO, three out of four vice presidents, and most directors. This can be explained by several hypotheses: career mobility (the absence of family obligations allows more time to devote to work), geographical flexibility (willingness to travel and relocate), or the life-stage effect (prioritizing career over family life during critical years of career growth).

An alternative explanation is related to age structure: many top managers may have been married earlier, but by the time they reach the peak of their careers, they are single for various reasons.
Intersection of factors: Demographic advantages matrix

A comprehensive analysis reveals a hierarchy of demographic groups by pay level:
1. Single women aged 40+ ($21.43) - absolute leaders, combining gender premium with age-related experience;
2. Single men aged 40+ ($18.09) - receive an age premium but lose out on the gender factor;
3. Married women aged 40+ ($17.66) - retain their gender advantage but lose out on family status;
4. Married men aged 40+ ($17.40) - the least privileged group in all respects;

This gradation is explained by the cumulative effect of demographic factors, where each parameter (gender, age, marital status) makes an independent contribution to the final level of compensation.
