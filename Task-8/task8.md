An analysis of AdventureWorks data reveals no clear positive correlation between supplier credit rating and total cash transaction volume. Although suppliers with the highest rating of 5 show the highest average transaction amount per supplier (over $1 million), the overall picture does not confirm the expected linear relationship. Suppliers with a rating of 1, despite their low credit status, generate the largest aggregate transaction volume ($54.1 million) due to the significant number of active suppliers (82 out of 100). It is particularly noteworthy that individual suppliers with average ratings, such as Vista Road Bikes (rating 3) with a volume of $20.9 million, are comparable in scale to top-tier suppliers with a rating of 5.
A detailed analysis of the distribution shows that AdventureWorks employs a diversified procurement strategy, not limiting itself exclusively to suppliers with high credit ratings. The average order amount ranges from $15,076 (rating 2) to $41,043 (rating 5), indicating a moderate correlation between supplier reliability and the size of individual transactions, but not the total volume of cooperation. This strategy allows the company to balance risk minimization through working with reliable partners and maintaining competitiveness through cooperation with a wide range of suppliers of varying levels, which is especially important in the dynamic sports equipment industry.
