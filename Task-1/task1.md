First, I need to figure out which letters from A to Z are completely missing from each position in the three-letter country codes. This means I need to compare the full alphabet against what's actually used in the database.
My strategy is to create a complete reference set of all 26 letters, then check each position separately to see which letters never appear there. It's basically a "what's missing" analysis.
Why Recursive CTE?
Instead of manually typing out all 26 letters, I can use a recursive CTE to automatically generate the alphabet. 
This is smarter because:
It's more elegant and shows advanced SQL skills
Less prone to typos
More maintainable
Demonstrates understanding of recursive patterns

## The Logic Flow
Generate complete alphabet A-Z using ASCII codes (65-90)
Extract individual letters from each position of country codes using SUBSTRING
Use LEFT JOIN to find which alphabet letters don't exist in each position
The LEFT JOIN + IS NULL pattern is perfect for finding "missing" elements

## Step-by-Step Reasoning
Start with ASCII 65 (which is 'A') as the anchor
Keep incrementing by 1 until we reach 90 (which is 'Z')
For each country code, split it into three separate letters
Compare each position against the full alphabet
When a LEFT JOIN returns NULL, that means the letter is missing from that position

## Why This Solution Works
The beauty is in the systematic approach - instead of guessing or manually checking, I let SQL do the heavy lifting. The recursive CTE automatically handles the alphabet generation, and the JOIN pattern efficiently identifies gaps.
I could have used a simple VALUES clause to list all letters, but the recursive approach is more sophisticated and demonstrates better SQL technique. For very large datasets, this approach scales well since it only processes distinct values.

## Expected Outcome
The result will show exactly which letters are playing hide-and-seek in each position, giving a clear picture of alphabet utilization patterns in country codes. Some letters like Q, X, or uncommon combinations will likely be the culprits missing from various positions.
This approach combines efficiency with elegance - it's both a practical solution and a demonstration of advanced SQL capabilities.

letter position_1 position_2 position_3
J        present    present    MISSING
Q        present    MISSING    present
X        MISSING    present    present
